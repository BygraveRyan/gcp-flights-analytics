# ✈️ GCP Flights Analytics Pipeline

A production-grade, end-to-end data engineering pipeline built on Google Cloud Platform — ingesting real-world flight data, transforming it through a Bronze/Silver/Gold lakehouse architecture, and surfacing insights via a Gemini AI-powered monitoring dashboard.

> Built as a hands-on learning project to develop real data engineering skills across the full modern data stack.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To design and build a complete batch data pipeline from scratch — covering ingestion, transformation, data quality, orchestration, CI/CD, and AI-powered monitoring — using the same tools and patterns found in production data engineering environments.

## 🔐 Infrastructure

**GCP Project:** `flights-analytics-prod`  
**Region:** `europe-west2`

**Service Accounts:**
- `flights-pipeline-sa` — Pipeline runner (functions, Spark, BQ)
- `flights-dataproc-sa` — Dataproc Serverless worker
- `flights-cicd-sa` — GitHub Actions deployments

**BigQuery Datasets:**
- `flights_raw` — External tables over GCS Silver
- `flights_staging` — dbt staging views
- `flights_dw` — SCD-2 dimensions and fact tables
- `flights_marts` — Reporting layer for Looker Studio

---

## 📐 Data Modelling

The warehouse uses **SCD Type 2** for dimension tables, tracking historical changes with `is_current`, `effective_from`, `effective_to`, and `row_hash` fields.

**Key Tables:**

| Table | Type | Partitioned By | Clustered By |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|
| `fct_flights` | Fact | `flight_date` | `carrier_code`, `origin_airport` |
| `dim_carriers` | SCD-2 Dimension | — | — |
| `dim_airports` | SCD-2 Dimension | — | — |
| `mart_delay_summary` | Reporting Mart | `summary_date` | `carrier_code` |

---

## 🤖 AI Monitoring

Phase 9 integrates **Gemini 2.5 Pro** directly into BigQuery via `AI.GENERATE_TEXT` to provide natural language pipeline health summaries — anomaly detection, delay pattern analysis, and data quality reporting — surfaced in a Looker Studio dashboard.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

This project is intentionally built across the full data engineering lifecycle to develop real, employable skills:

- Designing and implementing a cloud lakehouse from scratch
- Writing production-quality PySpark transformation jobs
- Building SCD Type 2 data models in BigQuery
- Orchestrating multi-step pipelines with Apache Airflow
- Applying data quality rules with Dataplex
- Integrating LLMs into data pipelines for AI-powered monitoring
- CI/CD for data infrastructure with GitHub Actions
